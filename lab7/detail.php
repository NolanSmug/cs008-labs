            <h2>Cars, Trucks, and Buses</h2>
            <p>Road vehicles are among the most common forms of transportaiton, especially in the United States. Light duty cars and heavier duty trucks and buses made 
                up 83% of our transportation greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 (EPA).  Out of every other country, American citizens drive the highest average of miles per 
                year (13,474), with Canada being second most at 9,562 miles per year. Part of the reason America is an outlier in this statistic is partly because
                our infrastructure has been built to favor road transport. There is over 6.8 million miles of road in the United States alone, which is also higher than 
                every other country (preceding India by almost half a million miles of road).

            <h2>Airplanes</h2>
            <p>Although airplanes also release heavy amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, jet engines also release water vapor, nitrous gases, and particles that
            reduce AQI (air quality). Water vapor itself does not live long in the atmosphere, however contrails that form from planes are the bigger issue. Under low temperatures,
            water vapor released from jet engines freezes creating lined contrails. These clouds stretch across the sky and trap infrared rays warming up the atmosphere 3 times more 
            than carbon dioxide.</p>

            <h2>Trains</h2>
            <p>In comparrison to cars and airplanes, trains emit over 60% less carbon, yet the United States lacks a developed rail system. According to the EPA (Environmental Protection
                Agency), freight trains made up just 1.9% of our transportation greenhouse gas emissions. Trains are both fuel efficient and don't create traffic and noise pollution like 
                trucks. If we were to replace every truck transport system in place currently with rail transit, we would cut our transportation GHG emissions by almost 75% (EPA).</p>
